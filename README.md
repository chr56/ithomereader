# ITHomeReader

A 3rd-party [ITHome](https://www.ithome.com) App. This is a project I made when learning Android in my free time. It is not affiliated with ITHome.

## To do

- [x] Remove 'kotlin-android-extensions'

- [ ] Use ktx libs and syntax
- [ ] Replace deprecated `ViewPager` with `ViewPager2`
- [ ] Fix other deprecated things

## Building

Modify `app/build.gradle` , remove `apply from: 'config.gradle'` or create your own `config.gradle` like below. It is used to define the update check URL.

    ext {
        updateUrl = 'YOUR_OWN_UPDATE_URL_HERE'
    }
    
Note: If you remove the config, you'll also need to remove or edit `manifestPlaceholders` for normal flavor.

For automatic signing, use signing.properties in project root. If you don't need this, remove related configs from build.gradle.

    keyAlias=
    keyPassword=
    storeFile=
    storePassword=

### Example of update info JSON

    {  
        "versionCode":122,
        "version":"4.3.16",
        "log":"What's new in this version...",
        "url":"https://example.com/new_version.apk"
    }
